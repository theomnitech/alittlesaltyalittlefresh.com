    <h2>Inspired by Water in Balance</h2>
    <p>
      Brackish Life is a coastal lifestyle brand rooted in the unique character of brackish water—where saltwater and freshwater meet. Founded in 2016 by Kyle Poore, a native of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, Brackish Life captures the spirit of life along estuaries like the Chesapeake Bay. The name itself evokes the mixture of salty and fresh elements that define the brand’s ethos: “A little salty… a little fresh.” This phrase not only refers to the aquatic blend found in brackish water but also reflects the attitude and identity of the people who live, work, and play along the shoreline. The company is deeply connected to the culture and environment of coastal communities and aims to provide apparel that reflects both function and lifestyle.
<br>The brand’s product line is wide-ranging and designed with outdoor and waterfront living in mind. From UV-protective performance shirts and hoodies to hats, decals, and casual tees, Brackish Life offers gear suitable for fishing, crabbing, boating, hiking, or simply relaxing by the bay. Their apparel often features regionally inspired designs, including blue crabs, oyster shells, compass roses, and references to waterman heritage. With collections for men, women, and children, the brand appeals to families and individuals who embrace the estuarine lifestyle year-round. The products are available through the official Brackish Life website (brackish.life), Shopify, and a network of retailers along the Chesapeake Bay region and beyond.
<br>Beyond merchandise, Brackish Life is also known for its commitment to conservation and community support. A portion of its proceeds is donated to nonprofit organizations such as the Talbot Watermen Association and Rink2Reef, the latter of which creatively transforms broken hockey sticks into oyster reef structures. These initiatives support marine habitat restoration and sustainable fishing practices, which are vital to the health of the Chesapeake Bay. The company also partners with local schools, sports teams, and conservation groups, reflecting a mission that goes beyond profit to promote stewardship of the land and water. In this way, Brackish Life is more than a brand—it’s a movement that celebrates and protects the balance between humanity and nature along our brackish shores.
